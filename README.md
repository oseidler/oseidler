Hi, I'm Owen Seidler, a programming student pursuing a master's degree at SMU Guildhall!

This GitHub page will feature different projects that I code during my time here at Guildhall. 

Current repositories:
- Engine: My current engine that I am creating in my software development classes, featuring both 2D and 3D capabilities
- Doomenstein: A simple recreation of basic Doom mechanics, made in my spring 2023 software development class
