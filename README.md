Hi, I'm Owen Seidler, a game programmer and recent graduate of SMU Guildhall.

This GitHub page will feature different projects that I coded during my time at Guildhall. 

Current repositories:
- Engine: My personal C++ engine made as part of the Guildhall programming curriculum.
- GravityFieldsThesis: The code from my thesis at SMU Guildhall, which is a recreation of the gravity field system from Super Mario Galaxy.
- TakeDownTheTower: A clone of the game Slay the Spire, made for my Directed Focus Study course.
- SimpleMiner: A program based on Minecraft, made as part of the curriculum at SMU Guildhall. 

Information on these and other projects from my time at Guildhall can be found at my portfolio link:
